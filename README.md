# One Hour Walker - Starter

This is the starter project for the AppCoda tutorial entitled [Building a Fitness App Using HealthKit to Track Walking Distance](http://www.appcoda.com/healthkit-introduction/).

It's a fun little app that tracks walking distance. Along the way, we read and write to HealthKit.
